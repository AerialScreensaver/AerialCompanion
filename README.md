To uninstall, simply delete `Aerial.app`. 

## A companion app for a screen saver, really?

Yes! Long story short: it's about auto-updates. With security changes made in Catalina, a screen saver can no longer update itself, which lead me to develop this new solution. As a bonus it takes care of installation if you didn't have a previous version already, and various issues one may encounter while installing. [More details here](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/blob/master/Documentation/Installation.md).

## Can I still just download the zip like I used to?

Yes! You don't have to use this companion app, but in order to get auto-updates, you'll either need this, or you'll have to install through homebrew. You can check the extended instructions here that recaps all of this.

## Why should I trust you ? Who are you ?

I'm [Guillaume Louel](https://github.com/glouel), the developer of [Aerial](https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial/) since version 1.4.
